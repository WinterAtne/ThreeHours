Positives:
I learned to make a game very quickly and expierenced real crunch for the first time.
Gauged the edges of my abilities, not in programming directly, but in time management and problem solving.

Regrets:
The particle system should've had more variety.
The shotgun should have had more pellets and wider spread.
I spent a lot of time, about thirty minutes, just making the very basic movement script for no reason.
